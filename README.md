# User-aided Pattern Search and Analysis on Business Graphs
Bachelor's thesis at HPI Potsdam

## Abstract
> Costructing a graph made up of thousands of businesses may be hard, but actually making sense of it is a lot harder.
> With huge amounts of data potentially being integrated into the data lake every day, automatic methods for finding interesting spots in the graph are needed.
> This paper discusses different approaches that can be taken to extract useful knowledge from such a graph.
